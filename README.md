# React GitHub API

Fetch and display basic user details from the GitHub API!

## Installation

Step 1 - Clone

```sh
git clone https://github.com/alexmccabe/react-github.git
```

Step 2 - Install dependencies

```js
yarn install // or npm install
```

## What it Does

Really simple app that allows you to search for a github username and displays some basic information about that user.

## What it doesn't do

Doesn't display any information about their repositories, their gists or any deeper information.

## Things I Would Improve Given More Time

- Tests
- Prop validation
- Better integration with my editor (eslint/prettier)
- Better directory structure (but right now, there's no need)
- Better styling
- More information (maybe show the user repos)
- Better error handling
- Caching of results

> Note: I spent slightly over the 2 hour time limit on this, because I was trying to get TailWind.css to install into an existing create-react-app. Turns out that it's janky at best, and I didn't like it. Went with Bulma instead.
